v6.26
(15/10/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- General | Support for Debian Jessie has now been fully dropped from DietPi code. Jessie systems are moved to the "jessie-support" Git branch and will stay on v6.25. Critical bugs, if reported, may still be fixed, but DietPi-Software related issues and new features will not be handled anymore by the DietPi code team. However, everyone is free to open pull requests against the jessie-support branch: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/tree/jessie-support
- General | Initial support and definitions for Debian Bullseye, the new Debian testing version, have been added to DietPi code. You can now create Bullseye systems via DietPi-PREP: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3009
- General | DietPi scripts, i.e. dietpi-software, will not overwrite you custom permissions in /mnt/dietpi_userdata anymore. Instead required permissions are now only applied for individual software titles that are being installed. Besides saving you time to re-apply custom permission, this as well enhances security in some cases where software installers/archives apply/contain stricter per-file/dir permissions. Many thanks to @JJGO and @johnvick for suggesting this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2641
- General | On first boot, when DietPi-Software finishes the initial setup, it is now assured that all APT packages, including firmware, are upgraded by performing an "apt-get dist-upgrade"/"apt full-upgrade". Since it includes upgrades regardless of underlying dependency and conflict changes, which in rare cases can perform unwanted removals, we do not do this on regualar DietPi-Update/Software runs. But on first boot, without additional packages installed yet, it is safe. Many thanks to @cmessin1 for doing this request: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3098
- Rochchip | Experimental GPU acceleration support for RK3399 SoCs and ASUS Tinker Board has been re-enabled.
- RPi | The haveged daemon has been replaced with rng-tools, an alternative which does not work on all devices, but has been proven to work on RPi, is default on Raspbian and uses less RAM on idle.
- RPi4 | The default CPU temperature limit (temp_limit) has been raised from 65°C to 75°C, since this device runs significantly hotter then previous RPi model. Many thanks to @trueaspects and @Trunkzeh for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3019, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3151
- DietPi-Globals | The environment variable $G_USER_INPUTS has been renamed to $G_INTERACTIVE, which describes better what it does. When setting this to "0", DietPi scripts will run non-interactively, i.e. all whiptail dialog prompts and other tasks that require manual user input are skipped. Note that this is not required when running scripts from cron jobs or systemd units, since those have no STDIN attached which makes DietPi scripts run non-interactively automatically. Scripts will stay backwards-compatible, thus respect $G_USER_INPUTS for a while, but please adjust your scripts or docs where you make use of it. Many thanks to @AtkLordOverAll for contributing this change: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3041
- DietPi-PostBoot | /var/log/boottime is not created anymore. Please use "systemd-analyze" to get much more accurate and detailed boot information.
- DietPi-PostBoot | The pre-login banner has been slightly adjusted: Default login credentials are now only shown on first boot, since the information is obsolete when user changed the password. As well an info has been added that one needs to hit <return> to show the username input field.
- DietPi-Banner/NordVPN: DietPi-NordVPN has a new input command to print the current VPN connection state: "dietpi-nordvpn status". This has been implemented as well into DietPi-Banner to optionally show NordVPN connection state on login automatically. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3084
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added options for connection up/down scripts, e.g. to implement killswitches, answer inbound connections from outside local network correctly, safe and track connection uptime, and similar tasks. Many thanks to @svh1985 for implementing this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3047
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options: Menu has been reworked. Audio capabilities (ALSA) can be enabled and disabled as a separate option. If enabled, generic sound card auto-detection has been added to the bottom of the list for all devices. This allows the selection of generic sound devices on all SBCs, e.g. if unknown to DietPi or if our hard-coded card/device IDs are wrong due to additional attached audio hardware.
- DietPi-Config | Some /etc/modprobe.d/ configs are merged to less files and mostly prefixed with "dietpi-", to allow easier differentiation between Debian/pre-image and DietPi files.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Update certain config.txt settings to match new firmware version. WiFi and Bluetooth is now disabled via related dtoverlays, which should further reduce hardware and firmware loads.
- DietPi-Config | Added overclocking profiles for RPi4. Many thanks to @aftensleuk for request and valuable suggestions: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=6225
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Re-added previously removed options to adjust initial turbo for CPU frequency on boot and to lower the idle CPU frequency. The related firmware issues have been fixed with a recent update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3147
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Removed the option to adjust CPU frequency limits. On RPi the dynamic CPU governors only jump between "arm_freq" and "arm_freq_min", hence those limits should be set via overclocking profile and the newly re-added "ARM Idle Frequency" option.
- DietPi-Config | RPi1/Zero: OpenGL modes/drivers can now be successfully selected/installed from display resolution menu.
- DietPi-Software | TightVPN: Since Stretch, TightVPN has been replaced by TigerVPN, thus the install option has now been removed from code.
- DietPi-Software | SDL2: Since we ship a tailored build for Amiberry, the general install option for SDL2 has been removed, instead it will be installed/updated along with Amiberry. If you require SDL2 for any other purpose, please install the "libsdl2-2.0.0" package from APT repository: https://packages.debian.org/libsdl2
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Logging to /var/log/pihole.log is now disabled by default, since it is not required in usual cases. Query logs, shown in web UI, are stored in database. This might also resolve possible pihole-FTL crashes in combination with DietPi-RAMlog and DietPi-Logclear. Many thanks to @kuerious for reporting and @Mcat12 for providing helpful information on this topic: https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL/issues/614
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Webserver configs have been added to block public access to the blocking page, optionally as well to the admin panel and generally block access to dot files/dirs (.git*) inside the admin panel directory. Parts are inspired by the official Lighttpd config, provided by Pi-hole: https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/lighttpd.conf.debian
                             Many thanks to @AtkLordOverAll for his effort to implement this for Lighttpd initially + the choice during install to block public admin panel access as well: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3054
- DietPi-Software | OpenVPN: Rsyslog is not installed anymore together with OpenVPN server. Logs are available via "journalctl -u openvpn", all system logs via "journalctl". If you require persistent logs, uninstall DietPi-RAMlog via dietpi-software and make the journal boot persistent via: mkdir /var/log/journal
- DietPi-Software | Gogs: On ARMv7 and x86_64 now the latest version from GitHub is installed. Reinstalls will upgrade the version while preserving existing settings. Many thanks to @LazyLama for doing this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2999
- DietPi-Software | Webmin: Install is now done via official APT repository to allow easier updates. To apply this to all systems, it is reinstalled on DietPi-Update to v6.26. Additionally the dependency on rsyslog has been removed. The Webmin logging panel still depends on rsyslog, but the overhead shall not be applied to all systems by default. Instead users can now decide themselves, whether they need to see system logs on Webmin, or not, and in case apply custom logging settings as well.
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Enabled support for RPi4 and Odroid XU4. Thanks to @midwan for providing the binaries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3104
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Updated install steps to avoid deprecations of the current upstream version. As well the service will not run as primary group "dietpi" anymore, which is only required for software that creates media files. Many thanks to @jcorporation (developer of myMPD) for providing this information as well as a smooth build script that updates old instances gracefully: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3097
- DietPi-Software | WiFi Hotspot: Since on some systems, a hostapd service mask was found, it is now unmasked on install. As well our custom compiled binaries are now only installed on RTL8188C* devices where no special Realtek hostapd package is available. Many thanks to @symbios24 for reporting the service mask issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2962
- DietPi-Software | Fail2Ban is not handled by DietPi-Services anymore, since the brute-force protection shall stay active during updates, installs, backups etc. The service is now started by systemd on boot and stays active until shutdown. Additionally on fresh installs the default jail.conf is optimised for the set "route" ban action: "blackhole" is now the route type, which does not send any respond to blocked requests.
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Support for RPi1 + RPi Zero (ARMv6 models) has been enabled by switching to Bullseye as source repo, which is available for Raspbian as well. Additionally on RPi, the WireGuard kernel module is now rebuilt automatically after kernel package upgrades. Many thanks to @johnnyt83 for suggestion RPi1/Zero support and his efforts to test the source build: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2997
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Version 1.9.4 will be shipped from now on. Many thanks to @msongz and @minhphuc429 for implementing this update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3138, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3154
- DietPi-Software | Aria2: Runs now as it's own user "aria2" and group "dietpi" with home dir and config file moved to /mnt/dietpi_userdata/aria2/. Besides satisfying security standards, this allows other download and media related software, provided by dietpi-software, direct access to Aria2 downloads without the need for custom permission changes. Additionally the current session (download states) are saved on service stop and every 60 seconds, to prevent current tasks from being lost on reboot or power loss. Aria2 will be reinstalled with v6.26 to apply these changes. Many thanks to @msongz for implementing and testing the session feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3139

Bug Fixes:
- General | Removed an obsolete OpenMediaVault cron job and binary that was leftover on at least one of our images (NanoPi NEO2) and is not part of the current OMV packages, thus save to remove in every case. Many thanks to @kt1024 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2994
- General | Resolved an issue where install of required APT packages for certain scripts could fail in the rare case that APT lists are outdated and old packages are not available in the repo anymore. Many thanks to @Paulisper for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2996
- General | Resolved an issue on some Buster systems where console-setup fails on boot to apply keyboard layout and console settings. Many thanks to @jaxjexjox for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2912#issuecomment-532100542
- Rock64/RockPro64 | Resolved an issue where DietPi could not obtain the active network adapter and IP, if onboard Ethernet was used. This is because of a kernel-related bug, which seems to cause Ethernet connection instabilities as well in cases. A workaround is applied to all new Rock(Pro)64 images and via DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @svh1985 for reporting this issue, as well as searching and testing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3066
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where the script did not exit on error: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3127
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue during first run setup, where DietPi-Software was called with mostly wrong whiptail menu dimensions. This lead to info prompts and menus being quite small, in particular the "Install" menu entry, that one needs to select, being only visible when navigating to the bottom. Many thanks to @pbecks1963 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3053
- DietPi-NordVPN | Resolved an issue where the server menu could have wrong entries or even fail, if foreign files were placed inside the config directory. Many thanks to @svh1985 for reporting this issue and implementing a fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3047
- DietPi-Run_NTPD | Resolved an issue where changing time sync mode or mirror, from within time sync error prompt, led to a concurrent script execution. Many thanks to @Sopor for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3010
- DietPi-Services | Resolved an issue where single service calls failed if their names contain certain special characters, like dots. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3059
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where I2C baudrate was not applied correctly, thus selection was ineffective. Many thanks to @flashspys for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2966
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi where headless mode did not disable all video outputs and framebuffer as intended, since the used config.txt setting has been removed with recent firmware versions.
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue on RPi4 where SDTV/composite video output did not happen when selecting the related resolution menu entries.
- DietPi-Config | On RPi4, vc4-kms-v3d option has been removed from display resolution menu, since the full KMS driver is not supported on RPi4 currently.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where the script tells you that SQLite will be installed as pre-req, while actually a desktop is required and LXDE will be installed.
- DietPi-Software | X11/Kodi on Odroid C2: Resolved an issue on Odroid C2 where Kodi failed to start. GPU drivers and X11 config will be updated during DietPi-Update to cover this issue. Many thanks to @alexeylutskov for reporting this issue and testing the fix: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3028
- DietPi-Software | Kodi: Resolved an issue where Kodi failed on RPi Buster and RPi4. Many thanks to @GulyFMG, @derdershat and @jonyskids for reporting this issue, searching and testing workarounds: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3031
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Resolved an issue where install fails on ARMv7 systems. Many thanks to @maschiw for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2959
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where install fails due to missing data dir creation. Many thanks to @Orfait for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2975
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: Resolved an issue where user creation fails if "gpio" group is not present. Many thanks to @marcobrianza for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2975#issuecomment-513917360
- DietPi-Software | OpenVPN: Resolved an issue where install failed on Debian Buster due to a new easy-rsa version with changed commands and options. Now the most recent easy-rsa is manually downloaded on all systems to generate server and client key + cert with modern methods and the client config is slightly updated to match modern settings.
- DietPi-Software | XRDP: On Stretch, new the version from backports is installed. This resolves a critical issue where /etc/profile was not loaded to the session and, due to incomplete $PATH variable, important system binaries were not available on terminal emulators which broke many install and upgrade tasks. Furthermore this resolves an issue where install and connection of XRDP failed if IPv6 was disabled. Many thanks to @aspinks for the debug session which allowed us to track the issue down to its root: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3017
- DietPi-Software | Sonarr: Resolved an issue where install failed due to an outdated APT repository key. Many thanks to @GregoryDosh and @GulyFMG for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3029
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: Resolved an issue where DietPi-Update failed for versions prior to v6.23, due to the obsolete Plex Media Server dev2day repository being offline now. This repo is now removed via pre-patches, prior to G_AGUP being called. During regular patches PMS is reinstalled, applying the new official APT repo. Many thanks to @p-roman for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3038
- DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Resolved an issue, where the blocking page was only shown, if the blocked URL contained the domain only, without any appending path: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/3072
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Resolved an issue on Debian Buster, where the VNC connection fails immediately due to an external bug, if no read-only password has been applied via vncpasswd. Many thanks to @Trunkzeh for reporting this issue and providing the workaround: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3070
- DietPi-Software | TigerVNC: Resolved minor error messages on login and in logs: "No session for PID ...", "DE is (null); No desktop environnement set, fallback to LXDE", "Use of uninitialized value $proto in socket at /usr/bin/tigervncserver"
- DietPi-Software | Netdata: Resolved an issue where install failed on Stretch systems. Many thanks to @Velociraptor85 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3062
- DietPi-Software | Amiberry: Resolved an issue where install failed on Buster due to changed library package version. The SDL2 library has been recompiled for Buster with minimal dependencies, thus X11 does not need to be installed anymore. Many thanks to @TuKo1982 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/3104

v6.25
(03/07/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- System | By default the "haveged" entropy daemon is now installed on all DietPi systems and patched with v6.25. It assures the pool of random bits /dev/random stays filled by using additional sources of randomness. This solves a bunch of issues, including hanging or very long boot times, very long service (re)starts or timeout failures and on Buster hanging network access. Especially affected is PHP7.3-FPM but as well VPN servers and WiFi hotspots and potentially many other network or cryptography related tasks. More information on this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2806
- System | Initial RPi4 support has been added to the code and some other rare RPi models are now detected correctly by their revision codes. Note that a new Buster-based image is required to support RPi4 and further work on DietPi-Config to support new RPi4 features. Full support is expected with DietPi v6.26, testing images can be found here: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2935#issuecomment-506389899
- DietPi-FirstBoot | First boot setup steps have been moved into a separate script and systemd unit. This allows further cleanup of the regular boot process and more targeted debugging and development. Many thanks for @FredericGuilbault for implementing this enhancement: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2791
- DietPi-Autostart | When choosing an autostart option that does not require a manual UNIX user login, the autologin user can now be chosen (which was always "root" previously). This can be applied automatically on firstrun setup with the new "AUTO_SETUP_AUTOSTART_LOGIN_USER" setting within dietpi.txt. If the user does not exist, is a system user (UID < 1000) or does not have a valid login shell, it will be reverted to root. Many thanks to @FredericGuilbault for suggesting this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2926
- DietPi-Globals | G_OBTAIN_CPU_TEMP(): Added support for Core2Duo CPU temperature to be printed on e.g. DietPi-Banner and "cpu" command output. Many thanks to @OstrovCity for posting the required information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2563#issuecomment-494388278
- DietPi-Service 2.0 | Combines dietpi-process_tool into dietpi-services. Adds I/O policies, single/global service control and much more: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2786
- DietPi-Process_tool | Has been replaced with DietPi-Services. Existing saved options will no longer be available, please use 'dietpi-services' to apply required process_tool options with the upgraded system.
- DietPi-Explorer | Disabled opening of files in nano under select a file/folder mode.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added the option to change the I/O scheduler per drive. Many thanks to @Generator for pointing us onto this topic: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2233
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Services are not stopped directly at start of this script any more. Instead this is done only on critical tasks, e.g. transferring of DietPi userdata, the swapfile or RootFS. Further increased navigation speed by re-running the drive detection loop only when affecting changes have been made, and, by several other code enhancements.
- DietPi-Config | APT Cache: We added new options to "dietpi-config" > "Advanced Options" > "APT Cache" to disable the APT cache or move cache, repo lists and/or package download dir to RAM. By default we disable the APT cache, which saves 50 - 100 MiB disk writes on each "apt-get update" call, but slows down "apt-cache" calls: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2840
- DietPi-Config | RTC mode: When selecting this option, a menu with additional info is shown instead of just toggling the state. Many thanks to @Sopor for this suggestion: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2826
- DietPi-Config | Audio Options (RPi): I-Sabre-K2M/Q2M sound card drivers are now integrated into the RPi kernel. These are now enabled on selection instead of compiling the drivers from source: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2690
- DietPi-Software | Mycroft AI FOSS voice assistant is now available for install. Many thanks to @LexiconCode for the initial request and all other requesters, FeatHub voters and testers: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1701
- DietPi-Software | Resolved some misleading outputs when having VNC Server or GPU using software installed. Many thanks to @mtpiercey for reporting these issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2870
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Lowered UMask (007 => 002) to allow read access from e.g. custom Samba shares without "dietpi" user. Many thanks to @radsb for reporting the limited access: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5847
- DietPi-Software | FFmpeg: On RPi, the new APT repo package will be installed, which now supports RPi hardware acceleration and is some subversion newer then the package hosted on dietpi.com: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/869#issuecomment-490047405
- DietPi-Software | Gitea: Current stable v1.8.X will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @msongz for implementing this: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2881
- DietPi-Software | myMPD: Current upstream version will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update, which requires a config file reset. A backup to recover custom settings from will be created: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2156#issuecomment-497513129
- DietPi-Software | O!MPD: Current upstream version will be installed now and existing instances will be upgraded during DietPi-Update. Existing config and database will be preserved. YouTube and Tidal support is added now by default. Many thanks to @ArturSierzant for giving valuable feedback and suggestions: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2884
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Reinstalls will now preserve existing configs and database.
- DietPi-Software | Medusa: mediainfo is now installed to enable Medusa gathering meta data and resolving related warnings in log. Additionally, on Stretch and above, Python3 is now installed and used, as recommended by Medusa for a while. Many thanks to @bluesmoke for suggesting this enhancement: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5945
- DietPi-Software | Node-RED: "sudo" permissions are now enabled by default: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2910

Bug Fixes:
- Network | Resolved an issue where an unintended Ethernet/WiFi IP value was shown if no IP is assigned.
- DietPi-Boot | Waiting for network timer now includes the start of 'ifup' for the device. This is to speed up boot time by threading the ifup command and allowing the wait timer to be more accurate.
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where login leads to immediate logout if DietPi scripts were not loaded to DietPi-RAMdisk location. Many thanks to @LexiconCode for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2841#issuecomment-494567292
- DietPi-Update | Resolved an issue where after update and reboot DietPi-Banner still shows update available with identical current and server versions.
- DietPi-Cleaner | Resolved an issue where the cleaner ran into an endless loop if "Files" cleaner was used. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2837
- DietPi-PREP | Resolved an issue where ifupdown (networking service) was autoremoved, which broke running network connections.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where idle spin down selection would always default to 241, instead of currently active value: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2852
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where eCryptfs fstab entries were not detected and preserved correctly. Many thanks to @johnvick for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=18428#p18283
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where transferring the RootFS to a BTRFS formatted drive fails. Since BTRFS support is not natively built into the RPi and Odroid kernel, a warning prompts and the transfer is aborted. Many thanks to @dieitpi for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=18164#p18164
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where on x86_64 systems a specific Seagate drive, attached via USB, does not spin down on idle. Many thanks to @tomillr for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2905
- DietPi-Config | (RPi) Resolved an issue where selecting sound cards with vc4 enabled would result with incorrect ALSA card index: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2173
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where selecting any locale (language) failed, which does not contain "UTF-8" in its name. DietPi only supports UTF-8 locales, but those available with UTF-8 only, do not have the ".UTF-8" suffix in their name.
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue on Buster systems that were dist-upgraded manually from Stretch, where DietPi-Software failed to obtain the global software password. Many thanks to @MattL0 for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2937
- DietPi-Software | Resolved an issue where audio software failed to use hardware acceleration on Buster. Users need to be part of the new "render" group on Buster to have permissions. Many thanks to @tomillr for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2916
- DietPi-Software | MotionEye: Resolved an issue on ARMv6 where install failed due to PHP Buster repo conflicts. Many thanks to @infinitejones for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2888
- DietPi-Software | Ampache: Resolved an issue where database connection failed when a custom global software password (other than "dietpi") was chosen. Many thanks to @WarHawk for reporting this issue and solution: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?p=15771#p15771

v6.24
(15/05/19 Hotfix)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Software | Emby + Plex Server: Enabled access to DietPi network mounts and media files by default. Many thanks to @ilgrank for reporting this missing feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2801
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud + phpBB: Support had to be disabled on ARMv6 for now until we either find a way to install PHP7.2 (with all required modules) outside of sury.org (which does not support ARMv6) or those enable support for PHP7.3 (expected with ownCloud 10.3 and phpBB 3.3).

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved a critical issue where PHP install/update broke ARMv6 devices since Debian armhf does not support ARMv6 like Raspbian does. Many thanks for the fast user reports: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2794
- DietPi-Software | PHP: Resolved an issue where APT upgrade can fail due to insufficient sury.org APT repo preferences. Many thanks to @sifyer for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2795

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.23
(12/05/19)

Jessie support:
- The support for Debian Jessie is fading constantly by software titles and Debian itself, increasing the effort for us to work around the raising issues: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332
- As a result we move Jessie systems to a dedicated "jessie-support" branch. Next DietPi v6.24 will still be merged into this branch as well, but for following updates it depends on how much additional related issues we face.
- We highly recommend to migrate to Stretch as fast as possible.
- Odroid C1: We have updated the image to Stretch based on ARMbian 4.18 kernel. Existing Jessie installations will be moved to the jessie-support branch: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2561

Buster support:
- DietPi-Software | Resolved the last failing installs on Debian Buster systems by either fixing or disabling them: phpMyAdmin and Tomcat8 are currently not available on non-RPi Buster systems.
- DietPi on Debian Buster x86_64 systems can be considered as compatible and stable now. On ARM devices some last software install tests are outstanding, especially on Raspberry Pi with Raspbian particularities. We will ship experimental images for testing purpose soon.

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-Banner | Added support for DietPi message of the day (MOTD). This is enabled by default, however, can be disabled. Checks for latest MOTD once a day.
- DietPi-Banner | Always prints the local IP during boot mode display: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2681
- DietPi-Benchmark | Increased default survey RootFS and RAM benchmark sizes. 100MB (from 10MB) for RootFS. RAM is 1/4 of available. This is ensure a more accurate calculation of throughput when we divide bytes against time, to obtain the MB/s result. Benchmarks now also run at Nice -19 and realtime I/O with priority 0 (highest).
- DietPi-Cleaner | Added a confirmation prompt, before removal of offline docs and man pages, as this may cause APT issues in some circumstances. Many thanks to @maartenlangeveld for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2751
- DietPi-LetsEncrypt | When applying to Lighttpd, "webroot" authentication is now used instead of "standalone". This allows the auto-renewal service to succeed while Lighttpd is running. Many thanks to @minnux for testing this method: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2680#issuecomment-480095449
- DietPi-Arr_to_RAM | With v6.18 we silently added a new script (for Stretch and above) that allows linking Sonarr/Radarr/Lidarr database files to RAM, increasing access performance, reducing disk I/O and avoiding constant external HDD spinning due to the very regular access to these files. This script has gone through some rework and polishing and can now be enabled to automatically link those databases to RAM on boot and store them back to disk on shutdown. For more details read: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=5828. Many thanks to @Dr0bac for providing valuable input and testing the development progress constantly: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2689
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | eCryptfs and vboxsf (VirtualBox shared folder) fstab entries are now preserved. Many thanks to @johnvick and @Phil1988 for suggesting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2078, https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2202
- DietPi-PREP | The script execution can now be fully automated via environment variables. Many thanks to @FredericGuilbault for adding this feature: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2756
- DietPi-Config | Added support to toggle Intel CPU turbo/boost mode. Requires Intel CPU that supports the feature.
- DietPi-Config | G_CHECK_URL: Added ability to change the connection attempts and timeout, before DietPi URL checking assumes a dead link and failure: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2717
- DietPi-Config | Serial/UART device handling has been reworked. Serial login consoles can now be toggled for every found serial device individually. On RPi the primary UART can be completely disabled and warnings are prompted if Bluetooth and login console are to be enabled both on ttyAMA0. On update existing systems will be patched so that serial-getty masks and enabled instances are removed if the related serial device does not exist. This solves some error messages during boot.
- DietPi-Config | Network Adapter menu has been cleaned up. Proxy variables are now sourced from "/etc/bashrc.d/dietpi-proxy.sh" and proxy setup outside of DietPi scripts is detected.
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added ability to toggle auto start/connect during boot.
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Package has been updated to v6.1.5. Many thanks to @spectrumcomputing: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2702
- DietPi-Software | PHP: All systems will be upgraded to PHP7.3 for security, performance, compatibility and consistency across distro versions. Ondrejs (official Debian PHP maintainer) PHP repository (sury.org) is used for this on Jessie and Stretch, so general functionality and trustworthiness is assured. ownCloud and phpBB users will stay on PHP7.2 for where PHP7.3 is not yet supported. Your PHP configurations will be backed up and webserver configurations adjusted to match the new version. Nextcloud 13 and earlier, especially Jessie systems, will be upgraded to Nextcloud 14 to allow PHP7.3. A full Nextcloud backup will be done, your data, settings and custom apps will be preserved. We strongly advice to further upgrade to the current Nextcloud major version via its web UI updater.
- DietPi-Software | Subsonic: Runs now as limited user "subsonic". This change is as well applied to existing installs via patch during DietPi-Update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2705
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard APT packages are now upgraded when running "apt-get upgrade". Many thanks to @swrobel for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2671
- DietPi-Software | LXQt, GIMP, XFCE4 Power manager: Now available for installations.
- DietPi-Software | Plex Media Server: All systems are migrated to the new official APT repository. This allows easy and consistent upgrades via APT. On ARM systems the until now used 3rd party dev2day repo receives no further updates and will be shut down soon, which makes the migration mandatory. Many thanks to @WolfganP for keeping us informed with news about Plex v1.15 and the new APT repo: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2655
- DietPi-Software | Logitech Media Server: Now installs the latest nightly version, since no public "releases" are done. As well the systemd service has gone through some update and now runs as limited user to align with other media servers, enhance security and follow the defaults of the DPKG package. The update/change is applied to existing installs via DietPi-Update as well. Your settings/date are preserved.
- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: We do not apply (D)TLS settings to coTURN any more. Since WebRTC is encrypted by itself there is no security benefit. More importantly Nextcloud Talk does not make use of the required TURNS protocol, so there is absolutely no point to apply these settings. The (D)TLS feature is meant to allow passing firewalls that only allow encrypted traffic. WebRTC, although encrypted, might not pass such firewalls since the encryption is not on transport layer. For those how are interested in further details and discussion: https://github.com/coturn/coturn/issues/33, https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/issues/257
- DietPi-Software | SABnzbd: Install latest version via GitHub master and skip adjusting existing config file. systemd unit and dependencies have been adjusted to match minimum requirements and official documentation. The update will be applied via DietPi v6.23 patch as well. Many thanks to @19eighties for reporting the outdated version: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2762
- DietPi-Software | Jackett: On non-ARMv6 devices the new (v0.11+) standalone (non-mono) binary is installed now. This is applied on DietPi-Update as well, preserving your settings: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2773
- DietPi-Software | Blynk: Enabled support for Debian Buster by using the new Java 11 binary.
- DietPi-Software | UrBackup: New version 2.3.8 is installed now. Many thanks to @DeathIsUnknown for informing us about the update: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2783

Bug Fixes:
- System | Debian has vastly reduced support for Jessie systems from their official APT repository. The limited possible list entries are applied during DietPi-Update. Many thanks to @BerndKohl for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2665
- DietPi-Set_swapfile | Resolved an issue where on first boot (and when calling the script manually) the swapfile creation is attempted on target file systems that do not support it (BTRFS). Many thanks to @mzramna for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/719#issuecomment-484205696
- DietPi-Config | Resolved an issue where proxy settings would not be correct after a reboot. Many thanks to @stephantual for reporting this!: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2704

The fix has been applied outside of the releases since only the online part of the updater is affected: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2684
- DietPi-Login | Resolved an issue where login as non-root user could result in a "sudo" password prompt or endless failure loop due to missing sudo permissions. Many thanks to @xsak for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2667
- DietPi-Software | Emby Server: Resolved an issue where download failed if the latest release does not contain a Debian package. Many thanks to @niblettr for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5755

v6.22
(23/03/19)

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- Security | The DietPi-Software global password is now stored with enhanced security which also resolves a warning on Buster systems: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2213
- System | /etc/bashrc.d/ now allows ".bash" file ending as well. We merged all contained DietPi scripts into one (/etc/bashrc.d/dietpi.bash): https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2636
- General | DietPi scripts now use the lightweight standalone "7zr" command to handle 7z archives. This allows us to lower the DietPi core package dependency from "p7zip-full" to "p7zip".
- RPi | DietPi does not set or change "framebuffer_depth" in config.txt any more which defaults to 16 which works in every known case. It will be re-added as fast as we find a case where another value is required.
- DietPi-Banner | You can now customise which options to display during system login. These include CPU temps, WAN IP, free disk space and more! Simply run 'dietpi-banner': https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2627
- DietPi-NordVPN | Added sent/received usage stats for VPN tunnel.
- DietPi-Sync | Sync will now abort if the source directory is empty. Merged dry run into real sync, as this was performed anyway to do required free space check. When "Sync" is selected, after dry run the user is presented a summary and given the option to view the detailed dry run log, cancel or continue with real sync. Some other minor fixes and enhancements have been applied as well. Many thanks to @midnightwatcher for doing this request: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=5588
- DietPi-Software | Emby Server: Now installs the latest version automatically (currently 4.0.2) which as well offers a native ARMv8 package: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2525
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Switched from 10.8.0.0 to 10.9.0.0 IP addresses on fresh installs to avoid doubled IP range use with OpenVPN. Many thanks to @XRay437 for pointing this out: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2491#issuecomment-461366739
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Changed the way users are advised to add multiple clients, to enhance concurrent connections. Many thanks to @curiosity-seeker for reporting and testing this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2491#issuecomment-462419860
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard: Hardened Debian Sid repo handling on RPi to prevent accidental non-WireGuard package installs. Many thanks to @rucknapucknavitz @1985kasper and @g7kse for reporting this issue: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2568#issuecomment-465725312
- DietPi-Software | GMediaRender: Enabled support for Debian/Raspbian Buster by using the up-to-date APT repo package.

- DietPi-Software | Deluge: Reworked the installer to better match the Debian package defaults and recommendations/examples from official docs. Deluge now runs as user "debian-deluged", logs have been moved to "/var/log/deluged/" and the init.d service with its traces are removed, which are all pre-generated by the Debian APT package. The systemd units have been adjusted according to the official Deluge documentation. These changes are applied as well to existing installs during DietPi update, the old user "deluge" and obsolete configurations are removed. Your active configurations and data are preserved, the installer has been as well enhanced to better handle existing installs and never touch existing configs. Note that access to the Deluge console has to be done as user "debian-deluged" (sudo -u debian-deluged deluge-console). A related access issue to the console has been fixed by this as well. Many thanks to @seanmikhaels for reporting this issue: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=5525
- DietPi-Software | AmiBerry: Updated to latest version (2.25), thanks @midwan: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2599
- DietPi-Software | Netdata: On Debian Stretch/Buster and Raspbian Buster an up-to-date APT package is available, which will now be installed instead of our custom build. Many thanks to @74cmonty for this information: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2446
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-RAMlog: When installing/enabling RAMlog, the /var/log mount point will be now cleaned before mounting the tmpfs on it, while preserving the existing logs metadata. This resolves a warning on early boot stage and frees the disk space consumed by the disk log before.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

v6.20
(28/01/19)

Image line-up:
- We removed Jessie images from our download server (besides for Odroid C1), since we see no advantage to use them anymore. Existing Jessie systems are still supported, but we encourage all users to consider switching to a fresh Stretch image by times: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332

Changes / Improvements / Optimisations:
- DietPi-PREP | Removed the option to install a Jessie system. Removed the option to install DietPi on top of a Wheezy image, since an upgrade over two distro version would be required, which is not reliable. It is still possible to install DietPi on top of a Jessie image, where a distro upgrade to Stretch would be applied: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2332
- General | RPi-Update: In our effort to improve system stability, and, offer software installations which build custom modules (e.g. WireGuard), we can not longer support systems with non-stock APT kernel installed. If "rpi-update" is installed during update, DietPi will prompt and return you back to stock APT kernel.
- General | Moved the remaining conf/* files located on DietPi-RAMdisk to /var/lib/dietpi or into DietPi-PREP, and removed /DietPi/dietpi/conf completely. These files were only used once or never, thus have no business inside the RAMdisk.
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Improved available options for HDMI boost setting: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2350
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Headless display mode is now applied via undocumented config.txt setting. Removed/Replaced some other obsolete config.txt entries: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2402
- DietPi-Config | RPi: Added info to "hifiberry-dacplus" sound device overlay that it supports the AMP2 DAC. Thanks to @Lat Dior for reporting the issue and testing the solution: https://dietpi.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=5396
- DietPi-Config | WiFi Hotspot: You can now toggle support for 802.11 N. Please note this is device and compatibility dependent, mileage may vary.
- DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now allows to check & repair the boot file system and trigger it for root file system on next reboot: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1740#issuecomment-388325204
- DietPi-Software | AmiBerry: Updated to v2.24, thanks @midwan! Brings several bug fixes, new features and improvements over the previous version (2.19). Please check the version history for full details on the changes made: https://github.com/midwan/amiberry/wiki/Version-history
- DietPi-Software | DietPi-NordVPN: Now available for installation. Includes a GUI which allows for easy connection to a list of NordVPN servers 'dietpi-nordvpn'. If you need a NordVPN subscription, please use this link: https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=5305&url_id=902
- DietPi-Software | WireGuard VPN is now available for installation. Is can be easily configured as client or as server, passing either all client traffic through the tunnel, local network access only, or server access only, e.g. as well in combination with Pi-hole, to have remote ad blocking.
- DietPi-Software | SickRage has been replaced by Medusa, which is now available for install: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2239

- DietPi-Software | Nextcloud Talk: Disabled the very verbose coturn logging by default to reduce disk I/O. This can be overridden via /etc/turnserver.conf: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2321
- DietPi-Software | Deluge: UMask 002 applied to all downloads: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2339
- DietPi-Software | Netdata: Updated to v1.11.1 and now runs as user "netdata": https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2337
- DietPi-Software | ownCloud/Nextcloud: Updated webserver configs to match current recommendations and security hardenings. Only applied on new installs. To apply manually, run "dietpi-software reinstall 47" (ownCloud) or "dietpi-software reinstall 114" (Nextcloud). You will be informed about the new configs, which then need to be manually moved to overwrite the old ones, since we don't want to mess with manual changes: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2361
- DietPi-Software | OpenSSH: Host keys won't be recreated anymore on reinstall, only on first boot of a fresh image, using now "dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server" to generate default key types based on distro.
- DietPi-Software | Dropbear: Now installs only the "dropbear-run" package on Stretch (and above), which matches the default DietPi setup on our images and PREP script.

- DietPi-Software | Gitea: New installations now install 1.7 (previously 1.4). Many thanks to @yumiris for this update! https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/pull/2448
- DietPi-Software | Grafana: Now the new official APT repo is used for all architectures (excluding ARMv6), which allows updates to the current upstream version (currently v5.4.3) as well. This change will be applied to existing installs on dietpi-update to v6.20. Thanks to @jvteleco for informing us: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2449
- DietPi-Update | Added optional ability to automatically update DietPi, when updates are available. Please note, this is disabled by default.
- DietPi-Sync | Removed the compression option, which has no effect on local sync, since files are not stored compressed, but only transferred compressed through remote sync protocols, which are currently not offered by DietPi-Sync.
- DietPi-RAMlog/Logclear | The internally rotated LetsEncrypt (CertBot) log files are now removed, hourly with DietPi-RAMlog enabled, or when executing DietPi-Logclear manually.

Bug Fixes:
- DietPi-Software | LXDE: Installation will no longer enable the weather application. This is due to Yahoo API hard coded into LXpanel, being taken offline: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/2416#issuecomment-456805925

DietPi-Software | A new unified download&install function is implemented, which allows more consistent download and install of software, using /tmp RAMFS as working directory and parallel dependencies installation via G_THREAD.
DietPi-Software | Koel: Installation will now skip webserver, as Koel uses PHP-CLI instead. To not mess with webserver served pages, Koel install directory is moved to "/mnt/dietpi_userdata/koel", for existing installs as well.
DietPi-Software | Mono: Now installs 'mono-complete' by default, required for Mono based applications (e.g. Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr/Jackett etc)
DietPi-Software | Lidarr: Now available for installation, automatically download music: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1874
DietPi-Software | Samba Server: Now creates and defaults to the login creds for the 'dietpi' user (previously 'root'). For fresh installations of Samba only: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1991#issuecomment-410505982
DietPi-Software | Folding@Home: Now available for installation on x86_64 machines. Folding@home is a distributed computing project for disease research that simulates protein folding, computational drug design, and other types of molecular dynamics. As of today, the project is using the idle resources of personal computers owned by volunteers from all over the world. Thousands of people contribute to the success of this project. Thanks to @nnovaes for bringing this to our attention!
DietPi-Software | XFCE: Added support for shutdown, restart, hibernate and suspend directly from XFCE panel by default. Existing installs will not be touched, but if required simply run: "apt-get -y install upower policykit-1"
DietPi-Software | Pi-hole: Installation code updated to support the latest release (v4). If you want to upgrade your existing installation, we highly recommend existing users who have this installed to: Uninstall Pi-hole via "dietpi-software", once completed, install Pi-hole again via "dietpi-software": https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1696
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Added NFSv3 mount support. Drive manager now detects NFSv3-only server and offers to enter the required server-side path to the shared folder: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1940
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Now installs "ntfs-3g" and "hfsplus" on demand, if those file systems are detected. This allows us to ship images without "ntfs-3g" and "hfsplus" preinstalled, which are not required by most users. Those packages will be removed on v6.13 patch as well, if the related file systems are not detected.
DietPi-LetsEncrypt | Added information/warning about HTTPS and HSTS according to web applications with standalone webserver: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1908
DietPi-Cron | /etc/cron.minutely/ is now disabled by default, to reduce cron executions and logs. This is also patched with v6.13, if no script is placed within the folder. Use "dietpi-cron" to enable and configure this feature.

General | By default systemd-logind is now masked on DietPi images. This can be changed by setting AUTO_UNMASK_LOGIND=1 within dietpi.txt. As well it will be unmasked automatically, if libpam-systemd was installed during dietpi-software installation: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1767
General | "fake-hwclock" is purged now on first run setup and v6.13 patch, if a real hardware clock is available.
Image | NanoPC-T4: Image updated which now includes custom kernel/modules created by @carlosedp. Adds CIFS, docker support and much more. Please note, WiFi scan is intermittent with this kernel, and, may take a few attempts to be successful, however, we believe the additional modules are a higher priority: https://github.com/MichaIng/DietPi/issues/1829
Image | RPi: New RPi images will be shipped without "initramfs-tools" preinstalled. The RPi bootloader does no require it and there are alternatives, e.g. "rpi-initramfs-tools" and "tiny-initramfs". The package can be manually purged on RPi systems, but "kmod" and "udev" need to be marked als manually installed first, so they will never be removed: "apt-mark manual kmod udev && apt-mark auto initramfs-tools && G_AGA"

Bug Fixes:
DietPi-Drive_Manager | Resolved an issue where mounting drives with the non-default path, would not re-select the same drive on the next screen.
